# CustomFont
G3D Font renderer ported to RBX.LUA.

Documentation on how to import different G3D font files will be provided soon. For now, have fun with lighttrek-small.
use `displayString()` to display text, multipler is text size, might have to add 4 to it but I don't remember.

~~Better documentation soon in general this is super hastily written and terrible lord forgive me~~
